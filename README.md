Hello people, 
I built this inventory management system for a cake shop in 2019 as an undergraduate student. This project displays dynamic update of pages when any update is performed. 
Performs CRUD operations using JSP and developed backend using MYSQL. Designed and developed a robust web application using Ajax technology to facilitate seamless
inventory record entry and updates
